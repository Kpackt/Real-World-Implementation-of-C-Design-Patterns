This is the code repository for [Real-World Implementation of C# Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1803242736), published by Packt.

**Overcome daily programming challenges using elements of reusable object-oriented software**

## What is this book about?
As a software developer, you need to learn new languages and simultaneously get familiarized with the programming paradigms and methods of leveraging patterns, as both a communications tool and an advantage when designing well-written, easy-to-maintain code. Design patterns, being a collection of best practices, provide the necessary wisdom to help you overcome common sets of challenges in object-oriented design and programming.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Get to grips with patterns, and discover how to conceive and document them
* Explore common patterns that may come up in your everyday work
* Recognize common anti-patterns early in the process
* Use creational patterns to create flexible and robust object structures
* Enhance class designs with structural patterns
* Simplify object interaction and behavior with behavioral patterns

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
public interface IBicycleProduct
{
 public IFrame Frame { get; set; }
 public ISuspension Suspension { get; set; }
 public IHandlebars Handlebars { get; set; }
 public IDrivetrain Drivetrain { get; set; }
 public ISeat Seat { get; set; }
 public IBrakes Brakes { get; set; }
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for beginner and mid-level software developers who are looking to take their object-oriented programs or software designing skills to the next level by learning to leverage common patterns. A firm grasp of programming fundamentals and classical object-oriented programming (OOP) using languages like C#, C++, Objective-C, or Java is expected.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-10 | C# 10 | Windows |
